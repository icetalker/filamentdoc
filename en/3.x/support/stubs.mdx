## Publishing the stubs

If you would like to customize the files that are generated by Filament, you can do so by publishing the "stubs" to your application. These are template files that you can modify to your own preferences.

To publish the stubs to the `stubs/filament` directory, run the following command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-stubs
```
